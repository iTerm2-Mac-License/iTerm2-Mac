## Overview

<a href="#">iTerm2 for macOS</a> expands on the built-in Terminal by adding panes, tabs and deep configuration options that appeal to heavy shell users. Sessions can be split horizontally or vertically so you can monitor logs, run tests and edit configuration all at once. Profiles allow different environments to boot with the right colours, fonts and commands, while hotkeys make it trivial to summon a window over whatever you are doing. For many developers, this becomes the control room where most day-to-day work happens.

Beyond layout, iTerm2 offers triggers, notifications and <a href="#">smart search</a> so that critical events in logs do not slip past unnoticed. You can highlight patterns, pop alerts on matches and quickly jump through history. Integration with tmux lets you detach and reattach terminal layouts across machines, blending local macOS comforts with remote persistence. Features like instant replay and paste history add safety nets around fast-paced sessions, making it easier to recover context after mistakes or interruptions.

On macOS, iTerm2 embraces system conventions while still exposing deep power-user options. Whether docked on a second screen or summoned as a visor from a hot corner, it adapts gracefully to different working styles. Over time, it evolves into a personalised environment tuned to your shell habits, hosting everything from quick one-off commands to long-running infrastructure sessions.
